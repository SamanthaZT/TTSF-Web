  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <img   src="https://cdn.everskies.com/media/attachment/E2M7qPLXEA8_NYzlMxG_.png"/>
    <p>Triangle TechServe Foundation is a nonprofit primarily dedicated to collecting old computers & parts, refurbishing them, and donating them to underprivileged communities. We have just incorporated our organization in NC are currently in the middle of filing for solicitor status,  which is required of a nonprofit in North Carolina to fundraise and ask for donations.  
  </br></br>
We plan to set up volunteer opportunities, such as opportunities with clubs at PCHS as well as larger clubs such as TSA, Key Club, and Film Club. We will organize events like electronic/book drives and fundraising events.
</br></br>
We offer multiple leadership roles in our organization as well as providing volunteer hours for clubs such as Key Club and NHS</p>
